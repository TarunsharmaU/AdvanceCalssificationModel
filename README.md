# AdvanceCalssificationModel

•Removing outlier by using isolation forest
•Check for class imbalance and correct them by SMOTE
•Learning Curve analysis to find best model out of two
•Finding out the best hyperparameters for optimized model using K-folds method
•Ensemble Models to use Voting, Stacking and Bagging algorithms to find combination of LR and NB models to give us the best combined model for prediction
